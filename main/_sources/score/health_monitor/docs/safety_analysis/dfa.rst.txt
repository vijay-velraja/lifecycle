DFA (Dependent Failure Analysis)
================================

.. document:: Health Monitor DFA
   :id: doc__health_monitor_dfa
   :status: draft
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :security: NO
   :realizes: wp__sw_component_dfa
   :tags: template

.. note:: Use the content of the document to describe e.g. why a fault model is not applicable for the diagram.

.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your Component.

    - Modify ``Your Component Name`` to be your Component Name
    - Modify ``id`` to be your Component Name in upper snake case preceded by ``doc__`` and succeeded by ``_dfa``
    - Adjust ``status`` to be ``valid``
    - Adjust ``safety`` and ``tags`` according to your needs
