Detailed Design for Component: HealthMonitor
===============================================

Description
-----------

HealthMonitor component consists of these units:

- `deadline_monitor`
- `logic_monitor`
- `health_monitor`

| Design Decisions - For the documentation of the decision the :need:`gd_temp__change_decision_record` can be used.
| Design Constraints


Implementation structure
------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    src
    └── health_monitoring_lib
        ├── cpp             # C++ API using Rust FFI
        │   ├── include     # C++ public header files.
        │   │   └── ...
        │   └── tests
        └── rust            # Rust implementation + FFI for C++
            └── deadline

Implementation approach for multi language
*******************************************

The implementation is done primarily in `Rust` language to leverage its memory safety features and concurrency model.
Due to a need to interface with existing C++ codebases, a C-compatible Foreign Function Interface (FFI) is provided by this `Rust` implementation.
`C++` API is designed to be idiomatic wrapping around the `Rust` FFI, ensuring ease of use for C++ developers while maintaining the safe usage.

Rationale Behind Decomposition into Units
******************************************

| mandatory: a motivation for the decomposition into one or more units.

.. note:: Reason for split into multiple units could be-
	    - Based on design principles like SOLID,DRY etc
	    - Based on design pattern's etc.
